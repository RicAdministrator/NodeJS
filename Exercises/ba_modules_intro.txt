Detailed:

What is a Module in Node.js?
Consider modules to be the same as JavaScript libraries.
A set of functions you want to include in your application.

Built-in Modules
Node.js has a set of built-in modules which you can use without any further installation.

Include Modules
To include a module, use the require() function with the name of the module:
var http = require('http');

Now your application has access to the HTTP module, and is able to create a server:
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
  res.end('Hello World!');
}).listen(8080);

Create Your Own Modules
You can create your own modules, and easily include them in your applications.
I created bb_myfirstmodule.js that returns the current date and time.
Use bc_demo_module.js to call bb_myfirstmodule.js
